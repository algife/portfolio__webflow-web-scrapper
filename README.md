# portfolio\_\_webflow-web-scrapper

> Load a webflow.io subdomain content in your own custom domain without paying for the PREMIUM plan nor using iframes. This web scrapper extracts a webflow page content and returns it in a RESTful API made with Express.js.

### One-Page only

As this is a prototype it is only useful for ONE-PAGE (no sub-pages) website. If you are looking for a more complex solution, a Node.js DNS server can be built using [DNS2](https://github.com/song940/node-dns)!

### The "Why"

Custom domains are only supported in Webflow premium plans.
If you have your own domain, you could (hypotetically) scrap a target webflow.io subdomain and return it as an endpoint result from your own server, enjoying a custom domain without having a Webflow premium subscription.

### Disclaimer

This is only a proof of concept and is not intended for commercial or personal use, only for education and experimentation purposes. It's always important to do ethical scrapping and respect the policies from each provider.
